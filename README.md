PROJECT STRUCTURE AND FILES

To understand the project better, let's look at its structure. The repository is organized into several key components:

Jupyter Notebooks: The core of the project is a series of Jupyter Notebooks that walk through each step of the data science process. These notebooks are interactive and contain the Python code, visualizations, and explanations for each stage of the project.

Data Files: The repository likely contains the datasets used for the analysis, which would include data collected from the SpaceX API and web scraping. This data would be in a format like a CSV file.

Final Report/Presentation: Often, capstone projects like this will include a final report or presentation that summarizes the findings. This could be in the form of a PDF or a PowerPoint file.

METHODOLOGY

The README provided a high-level overview of the methodology. Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of what you would likely find inside the project's notebooks:

Data Collection:

SpaceX API: The project uses the SpaceX REST API to gather detailed information about past launches. This would include data points like launch dates, rocket details, payload information, and launch sites.

Web Scraping: To supplement the API data, the project likely uses web scraping techniques (with libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python) to extract additional information from web pages like Wikipedia.

Data Wrangling and Cleaning:

This is a crucial step where the raw data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involves:

Handling Missing Values: Dealing with any gaps in the collected data.

Feature Engineering: Creating new variables from the existing data that might be useful for prediction.

One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical data (like launch sites) into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This is where the project really dives into the data to uncover patterns and insights. You would see a lot of data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to answer questions like:

Which launch site has the highest success rate?

Is there a relationship between payload mass and landing success?

How has the success rate of landings changed over time?

SQL queries might also be used to filter and aggregate the data for analysis.

Interactive Visualizations:

To make the data more engaging, the project uses libraries like Folium to create interactive maps of the launch sites.

Plotly Dash is used to build a web-based dashboard where users can interact with the data and visualizations.

Machine Learning Prediction:

This is the core of the project, where different machine learning models are built and tested to predict the success of a first-stage landing. The typical steps are:

Model Selection: Choosing several classification algorithms to test, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Training and Testing: The data is split into a training set (to build the models) and a testing set (to evaluate their performance).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models to improve their accuracy.

Evaluation: Comparing the performance of the different models to find the best one for the job.
